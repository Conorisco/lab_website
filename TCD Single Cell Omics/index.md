# Single cell core facility

We have launched a single cell omics core facility based in [TTMI](https://www.tcd.ie/ttmi/). We perform multiplexed single cell RNA-sequencing runs using the BD Rhapsody pipeline and Scale Biosciences pipelines. The service operates on a fee-for-service cost recovery model.
